<h2>NBA Champions of the 2020's</h2>

	<h4>2020 Los Angeles Lakers</h4>
	  <p>Nicknamed "The Bubble" season in which the NBA was held inside a Bubble in Disney Land, this ring is sometimes considered "fradulent". However, the champions this year, The Lakers, were a dominant team that deserved a real, hard-fought ring. This squad was led by the power duo of LeBron James & Anthondy Davis. During this run, this team only lost 5 games total, defeating the Jimmy Buttler led Miami Heat 4-2 in the Finals. In this champioinship Lebron won Finals MVP, serving as one of the most meaningful championships in both Lebron's & the franchise's history.</p> 
		  
	<h4>2021 Milwaukee Bucks</h4>	
		<p>The Bucks were the NBA Champions in the 20-21 seasoon. This team was led by Giannis "The Greek Freak" Antetokounmpo, who had a historic playoff performance, especially in the Finals, averaging 35.2 / 13.2 / 5.0 per game. In the deciding Game 6, he was able to score 50 points to secure the title at home. While only being a third seed with one All-Star in Giannis, a strong supporting cast created a strong title team that goes down as one of the Buck's defining moments</p>

	<h4>2022 Golden State Warriors</h4>
		<p>After not getting a ring in 8 years, Steph Curry & the Golden State Warriors secured their fourth title of the modern NBA. Often called the defining moment of Curry's career, he was able to lead one of the weakest title teams of all time to a ring after going through a drought, showing that Curry could win without having a superteam. The Warriors defeated the Celtics in the Finals 4-2, with Stephen Curry being named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career after averaging 31.2 points per game in the series.</p>
	<h4>2023 Denver Nuggets</h4>
		<p>The 2022-23 Denver Nuggets won their franchise's first NBA championship & achieved the 1st in the Western Conference in their 47-year history. Led by a then 2x MVP Nikola Jokic & a healthy, playoff-rising Jamal Murray, the Nuggets dominated both the regular season & the playoffs. They went 53-29 in the regular season, and a strong 16-4 record in the postseason. While the Nuggets were a very strong team, they had what is often considered weak playoff matchups, playing injured teams & a weak Play-In Miami Heat in the Finals, who barely even made it into the playoffs.</p>
	<h4>2024 Boston Celtics</h4>
		<p>After a young Celtics team got shut down by the Warriors in the 2022 Finals, the Celtics returned to the Finals with a deeper, more experienced team that was able to finally achieve the title. The Celtics were a strong, fully complete team that was decked with star & defensive pieces from top to bottom. The Celtics team was extremely dominant with a 64-18 recprd, 16-3 postseason, & an NBA record for the highest offensive rating in league history at 123.2. Despite an underpeformance by main star Jayson Tatum in the Finals, the Celtics were still able to steamroll the 2024 Mavericks in the Finals 4-1. Sidekick Jaylen Brown was able to clinch the Finals MVP over Tatum, showing just how much depth this team truly had.</p>
	<h4>2025 OKC Thunder</h4>
		<p>The 2024-25 OKC Thunder won their first NBA championship since relocataing to Oklahoma City. Despite a dominant regular-season with a 68-14 record, the Thunder had some suprising struggle in the postseason, being taken to two Game 7's against the Nuggets & Pacers in the Finals. Much like the 24' Celtics, the Thunder had an extremely deep roster that still had overwhelming star power in their big three of SGA, Jalen "J-Dub" Williams, & Chet Holmgren. In the Finals, the Thunder faced the underdog Pacers who are known for their unbelievable run as a 4th seed after a historic performance by Tyrese Haliburton. Haliburton notably hit 4-game winning or tying buzzer beaters throughout the postseason, including a Game 1 buzzer beater in the NBA Finals against the Thunder.</p>
