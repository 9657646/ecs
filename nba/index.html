	  <h2>My Tennis Career</h2>

	  <h3>Where It Started</h3>
	  <p>I started playing Tennis at the ripe age of 8 years old, in which I practiced at the Salt Lake Health & Tennis Club. I continued to play for a few more years until I quit tennis around 5th grade, ultimately returning in 7th grade. I've come a long way since I was 8 years old, and have met many people & gained some great experiences from tennis.</p>
